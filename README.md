# sorting
My various projects on sorting in Python. Features an old, old directory (`school`) from when I was in year 10 and did an investigation into sorting algorithms, which devolved into comparison-less integer sorting. It's a mess. The newer part is a mix of pure-Python and processing, which is a project in progress, hoping to get some clean, efficient sorting implementations in Python and visualise them in addition to providing command-line support. `pure` contains pure implementations - in the main directory generator versions are provided (which allow the sort to block itself while keeping state). They're also Python 2 as that's my processing installation.
