# sorting
My various projects on sorting in Python. Features an old, old directory (`school`) from when I was in year 10 and did an investigation into sorting algorithms, which devolved into comparison-less integer sorting. It's a mess - the rest is a Processing project in progress, hoping to get some clean, efficient sorting implementations in Python and visualise them in addition to providing command-line support.
